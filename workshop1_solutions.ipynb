    "## Workshop 1: Scientific Python Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### T.J. Ragan and James Pickering\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally by Software Carpentry (Cindee Madison and Thomas Kluyver, with thanks to Justin Kitzes and Matt Davis). Lightly modified by T.J. Ragan and James Pickering.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the introductory lecture, Python is a programming language that is easy to write, and very easy to read - an ideal choice for beginners. However, you'll find that many features of Python are common to other programming languages. Knowing how to program in one language makes learning others you might encounter much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to start learning the basics. In this workshop, we're going to:\n",
    "- Learn the basic structure of Python, and learn to use Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Understand variables and basic functions.\n",
    "- Write a short script to calculate molarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We're doing this workshop in an interactive notebook called **Jupyter**. A Jupyter notebook is a place where you can run snippets of Python code in individual *cells* - it's not just an educational thing, lots of us writing Python in real life use Jupyter every day (like me!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell has both an *input* (marked \"In [number]\") and an *output* (marked \"Out [number]\"), where the cells are numbered sequentially. The input is what you tell the computer to do, and the output is what the computer sends back to you in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll get used to how to run cells as we go along, but here are a couple of useful tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIP**: To run the code in a cell quickly, hit Ctrl-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIP**: To run the code in a cell and move to the next cell, hit Shift-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIP**: To make a new cell below the current cell, type Ctrl-m and then b. Other shortcuts for manipulating cells are in the menubar at the top of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Individual Things\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic component of any programming language are \"things\" - also called *variables* or (in special cases) *objects*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of basic \"things\" would be numbers (*integers* or *floats*), bits of text (*strings*), and True/False logic values (*booleans*). We'll meet many of these today, and will keep seeing them throughout this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples of \"things\" now. Note that any line of Python code that starts with a hash (#) symbol is a *comment*. Comments don't get run by the computer, and are just there so that the programmer(s) can make notes and document what the code does.\n",
